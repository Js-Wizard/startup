            <h1>How to play Fim</h1>
            <p>
                Fim is a two-player turn-based pure strategy game. The state of the game is represented by a grid of numbers. Each turn is made by picking a valid number.
                To start, the first player may choose any number except 1. This becomes the current number. The second player then chooses a valid number. The current number
                then becomes a used number, and the chosen number is the new current number. Then it is the first player's turn again, and play continues until there are no
                valid numbers for a player to choose from. That player loses, and the other player wins. A valid number is defined as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Must not be a used number</li>
                <li>Must not be the current number</li>
                <li>
                    Must be either:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A factor of the current number, OR</li>
                        <li>The sum of the current number and a used number</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This game is inspired by "Nim", a similar game where players take turns removing a chosen amount of items from a pile. The name "Fim" is a combination of
                Nim and the f in "factor". Both games have a winning strategy, but finding the winning strategy for Fim is likely not solvable in polynomial time.
