# Fim

## Description deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Games like Chess and Go have been around for centuries, but they lack one thing: simplicity. I present a game which is the solution. Fim is a pure strategy game that is very difficult to master, but it is easy to learn and each game takes only a few minutes. It's so simple, it can easily be played with pencil and paper! Each move consists of choosing a number, which is a simple click of a button on a computer interface. You can play a quick game with a friend, or practice your skills against a computer opponent.
