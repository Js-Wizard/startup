# CS 260 notes

These are notes from the CS 260 course that I will be able to use on exams.

## GitHub

Git is a version control software that has several crucial features for code development, such as:
- Keeping track of changes to code, so that older versions can be restored if needed
- Creating branches to experiment with new features without ruining anything
- Transferring code and changes between devices to facilitate collaboration

GitHub is a cloud-based service that enhances Git with additional features:
- Storing repositories in a central and publicly accessible location
- Advanced project management
- Pull requests, which enable community collaboration
- Fork someone else's repository to make your own version of it, to experiment or contribute
- and more

To create a Git repository with GitHub:
1. Create repository in GitHub
2. Copy clone URL
3. Paste into command line after `git clone` when in the desired location

To modify from development environment:
1. `git pull` to get latest version from GitHub
2. Modify files as desired
3. `git add` on modified files to apply changes to
4. `git commit -m "(message)"` to locally commit changes
5. Repeat 2-4 for each major set of changes
6. `git push` to apply to GitHub repository

Other Git commands:
- `git fetch` updates cache with information about the state of the GitHub repository
- `git status` evaluates difference between GitHub cache and local files

GitHub .md files use _markdown_, which is syntax to represent visual elements applied to the text.

## Internet

- Layers (TCP/IP model)
  - Application
    - For example, HTTPS
    - Application implementation
  - Transport
    - For example, TCP/UDP
    - Creates stable connections and ensures data reaches its destination
  - Internet
    - IP
    - Sends data between systems
    - Use `traceroute` to get points along route to a certain address
  - Link
    - Fiber, hardware
    - Phyically connects machines
- Protocols
  - Application
    - HTTP
      - Original web application protocol
      - Use `curl` to make an HTTP request
    - HTTPS
      - HTTP but secure
      - Uses TLS
      - `curl -v` will show TLS handshake
    - TLS
      - Wrapper for transport layer that encrypts sent data

## Tools

### DNS

- Register IP address corresponding to the server
- Commands
  - Run `dig` to get ip address of domain from DNS
  - Run `whois` to get informatino about the owner of a domain
- TLD: top level domain
  - Rightmost
  - e.g. com, edu
  - Managed by ICANN
- Secondary domain
  - Second-to-rightmost
  - Managed by authoritative name servers
- Subdomains
  - Third, fourth, etc
  - Managed by owner of a root domain
- Root domain: secondary domain + TLD

```
p {
    color: red;
}
```

    - `div > p`
  - General sibling: selector must have a certain sibling
    - `p ~ div`
  - Adjacent sibling: selector must have a certain adjacent sibling
    - `p + div`
  - Pseudo: selector with state-based requirement
    - `p:action`

  - To condition rules on device status, use `@media` query
  - 
- Frameworks
  - Packages to make CSS faster by simplifying common patterns
  - To include, use external stylesheet in link and include javascript file in body
  - To use, add special class names to specific elements
  - Example: Bootstrap
 
### Javascript

  - `alert`
  - Change HTML
- Breakpoints
  - `debugger;`
  - Will stop there and pull up sources tab in debug

      - string + number + string
      - number * string = NaN
      - array + array = string
      - true + null = 1
      - true + undefined = NaN
  - Equality
    - `=`: assignment
    - `==`: "casted" equality (don't use)
    - `===`: true equality
  - Conditionals
    - Cast to boolean
      - "falsy": 0, -0, '', NaN, null, undefined
      - "truthy": everything else
    - `switch` can use any type
    - `??` operator: use left value if defined, else right value

    - `a.map`
      - Applies function to each element and returns result
    - `a.reduce`
      - Reduces array to a single value
      - Uses a function that takes in the current total and the next element
      - Total is set to first element, then repeats `total = f(total, a[i])` for remainder
    - `a.filter`
      - Returns array with elements that are matched by the provided function
    - `a.some`
    - `a.every`
    - Iterate:
      - Indices: `for (let index in numbers)`
      - Values: `for (let value of numbers)`
    - Spread / Rest
      - `...x` as a parameter = Rest
        - Takes multiple parameters and combines into an array
      - `...x` as a value = Spread
        - Takes an array/object and separates it into array/object values or function arguments (array only)
  - Functions
    - To declare: `let f = function(x) {}`
    - Alternate syntax: `function f(x)`
    - Arrow function syntax: `(params) => {}` or `(params) => expression`
    - Missing parameters are undefined
    - If function doesn't return, the return value is undefined
    - Optional parameter: `param = val`
      - Default value if it doesn't get passed in
    - Closures
      - A function returning a function
      - Variables in the returned function include the scope of the closure
  - DOM
    - Can manipulate with JS
    - `document`: root element in DOM

        - Use `window` for entire window
  - Useful built-in functions
    - `setTimeout`
      - Sets a timer to call a function when it runs out
    - `clearTimeout`
      - Cancels a timer
  - Objects
    - Can be directly declared with `{ key: value, key: value, ... }`
    - Objects can be nested
    - Additional attributes can be assigned to objects even if they don't exist yet
    - Iterate through properties
      - Properties: `for ... in`
      - Values: `for ... of`
  - Destructuring
    - `[a, b] = arr`
    - Equivalent to `a = arr[0], b = arr[1]`
    - Can be used as a function parameter: `function f([a='default',b='default']) {}`
    - Also applies to objects; this can be used as a weird equivalent of python keyword arguments
  - Asynchronous handling: Promise
    - 3 possible states
      - Pending
      - Success
      - Failure
    - Syntax
      - `new Promise(function)`
      - `.then(successFunction, [failureFunction])`
      - `.then(successFunction, [failureFunction])`
      - ...
      - `.catch(failureFunction)`
    - Alternate method: async + await
      - Call inside function declared async
      - `const result = await func(...)` or `const result = await new Promise(func)`
      - And then use try/catch for failures
  - Classes
    - Use `class` to declare a class
    - `static` keyword for static variables
    - To declare constructor: `constructor() {}`
    - Inheritance: `extends`
    - `super`
    - Convention for private variables: start with underscore
    - `get`, `set`
      - Example: `get prop() {return this._prop;}`
    - Use `this` to refer to the instance of the object
    - No `function` keyword needed for class methods
  - `localStorage`
    - Acts as a persistent object
    - Can only store string, number, or boolean
    - `localStorage.setItem(key, value)`
    - `localStorage.getItem(key)`
    - `localStorage.removeItem(key)`
    - `localStorage.clear()`

        - Accessible within the module (but not from HTML)
      - Function
        - `var`
        - Accessible within the same function
      - Block
        - `const`, `let`
        - Accessible within braces
    - `this` keyword
      - `this` outside function/object: refers to runtime context (window)
      - `this` in object: refers to the object
      - `this` in function: refers to global this (or undefined if strict) if not owned by object, or the object if owned by object
    - Closures
      - Variables can always be referenced as long as they are in scope, even if a function declared in the scope is used outside of the scope
      - Arrow functions are different, they use the scope of the creation context
- JSON
  - Representation of the data in a JavaScript object
  - To convert from object to JSON: `JSON.stringify(obj)`
  - To convert from JSON to object: `JSON.parse(str)`
  - Does not include functions
  - Useful for `localStorage`
- Event handlers
  - Some HTML elements have handlers that can be attached to JS functions
  - `<element>.addEventListener`
    - Dynamically add a handler
- Modules
  - Use `export` before function declaration to make something available to other modules
  - use `import { <func> } from 'file'` to get a function from another module
  - Modules can only be accessed from other modules
    - Exception: attach function to `window` object or use `addEventListener`
